## Technology Deep Dive

### Three.js - 3D Graphics Library

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

**How Three.js Works:**
- **Scene Graph:** Hierarchical structure containing 3D objects, lights, and cameras
- **Renderer:** Converts 3D scene data into 2D images using WebGL
- **Geometry:** Defines the shape and structure of 3D objects
- **Materials:** Define surface properties like color, texture, and lighting response
- **Mesh:** Combination of geometry and material to create renderable objects

**Core Components Used in Project:**
- Scene management for world organization
- Perspective camera for first-person view
- BoxGeometry for block creation
- TextureLoader for Minecraft-style textures
- DirectionalLight and AmbientLight for realistic lighting
- WebGLRenderer with shadow mapping support

### Vite with Vanilla JavaScript

Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast development server and optimized production builds.

**Vite Features:**
- **Lightning Fast HMR:** Hot Module Replacement for instant updates
- **ES Modules:** Native ES module support in development
- **Build Optimization:** Rollup-based production builds
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extensive plugin support
- **TypeScript Support:** Built-in TypeScript compilation

**Benefits for Game Development:**
- Instant server startup and file changes
- Optimized asset handling for textures and models
- Tree-shaking for smaller bundle sizes
- Development server with automatic browser refresh

### React.js vs Vite with Vanilla JavaScript

| Aspect | React.js | Vite + Vanilla JS |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper - JSX, components, hooks | Gentler - Standard web APIs |
| **Performance** | Virtual DOM overhead | Direct DOM manipulation |
| **Bundle Size** | Larger (React runtime) | Smaller (no framework) |
| **Development Speed** | Component reusability | Direct implementation |
| **Game Development** | Additional abstraction layer | Direct WebGL/Three.js access |
| **State Management** | Built-in state management | Manual state handling |
| **Build Process** | Create React App or custom | Vite's optimized build |
| **Debugging** | React DevTools required | Browser DevTools sufficient |

**Why Vanilla JS + Vite for Game Development:**
- Direct access to performance-critical APIs
- No framework overhead for real-time applications
- Easier integration with Three.js and WebGL
- Full control over rendering pipeline
- Simpler debugging for graphics-intensive applications

- Player bounding cylinder visualization
- Real-time position tracking

**Control System:**
```javascript
// Player movement with velocity-based physics

this.velocity.z = this.input.z;
this.controls.moveRight(this.velocity.x * dt);
this.controls.moveForward(this.velocity.z * dt);
```

## Technical Deep Dive: Collision Detection

### Three-Phase System:

#### 1. **Broad Phase** - Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Find blocks within player bounds
const extents = {
  x: { min: Math.floor(player.position.x - player.radius),
       max: Math.ceil(player.position.x + player.radius) },
  y: { min: Math.floor(player.position.y - player.height),
       max: Math.ceil(player.position.y) },
  z: { min: Math.floor(player.position.z - player.radius),
       max: Math.ceil(player.position.z + player.radius) }
};
```

#### 2. **Narrow Phase** - Precise Detection
- Calculate collision points
- Determine overlap between player and blocks
- Find collision normals for proper response

#### 3. **Resolution** - Physics Response
- Adjust player position to prevent clipping
- Zero velocity in collision direction
- Maintain realistic movement
